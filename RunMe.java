Current version made by: Max on 10/4/2025
Quite possibly the stupidest class I have had to make.
The SOLE purpose of this class is to call the main method of
Max_Main_view_test. In looking for solutions to the error I
was having this was a suggested solution, and it worked. So
I suffer with the creation for this stupid ass class :(

public class RunMe {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Max_Main_view_test.main(args);
    }
}
